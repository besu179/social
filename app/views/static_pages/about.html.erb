  <h2 class="h4">About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a full-featured Ruby on Rails web application that includes user registration, authentication, micropost creation, password reset, account activation, and user following (like a mini social network). Each chapter of the tutorial has been carefully implemented with attention to real-world software development practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final version will demonstrate concepts such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive layouts using Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Secure user authentication</li>
      <li>RESTful routing and MVC architecture</li>
      <li>Reusable components with partials and helpers</li>
      <li>Clean and user-friendly design</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
